- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @xXalexAdamsXx
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making people happy by making their life easier through software!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, Algorithms, Python, and a whole bunch of other tools that I can leverage to make my dreams come true.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at alexadams6@icloud.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: The first time I coded, I told my parents that coding wasn't for me.
  - After telling them that, I went back to working on my coding project for 8 hours straight because I was having so much fun! Ever since I knew that being a software engineer was my dream
