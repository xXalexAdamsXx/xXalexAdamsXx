- 👋 Hi, I’m @xXalexAdamsXx
- 👀 I’m interested in making people happy by making their lives easier through software!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... the language that I am currently hired to work with. Not that I don't know it, the learning just never ends! There's always something to learn in this field, which is why I love it so much!! If you want to know something specific, I'm still figuring out how to center a div lol.
- 📫 You can reach me at alexadams6@icloud.com
- 🤝 Check out my LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/alex-l-adams. There's a whole lot more to me than writing epic programs.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The first time I coded, I told my parents that coding wasn't for me.
  - After telling them that, I went back to my Code.org IDE and worked for 8 hours straight because I was having so much fun! Ever since I knew that being a software engineer was my calling.
  - Professionally trained in Swagonomics (And by 'Swagonomics', I mean staring at my computer for longer than 12 hours a day).
